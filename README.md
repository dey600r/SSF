# Simon Street Fighter - SSF
The Simon Street Fighter app combines 2 traditional games into one. The mythical game "Simon says" with the fighting game "Steet Fighter". It consists of a turn-based game in which you have to enter a word in order to attack or defend yourself against your opponent.

This game was developed in my college period in a practice with another classmate.
